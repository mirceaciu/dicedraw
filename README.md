# dicedraw
Create a portrait of yourself made from dices using script.

Point it to a portrait photo (color or grayscale) and set the desired number of dices per row. 

It will calculate how many dice you will need to recreate the portrait and will output helping files:
 
 - color images with dice numbers grid overlay
 - grayscale image with dice numbers grid overlay
 - grayscale image of actual dice faces rendering
 - csv file with row by row mapping of dice placement
